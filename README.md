**AGROHARVEST**

Farming is one of the major sectors that influences a countryâ€™s economic growth.

In country like India, majority of the population is dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. Many new technologies, such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning, are being implemented into agriculture so that it is easier for farmers to grow and maximize their yield.

In this project,I developed a tool in which the user can provide all the details needed to grow a crop such as Temperature,Humidity,Rainfall,etc and the algorithm predicts which crop the user should grow.
I tried out several algorithms and compared their accuracy.
